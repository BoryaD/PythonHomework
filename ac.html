Republican Gov. Gary Herbert announced Tuesday night that church leaders back a regulatory rule his office helped craft after legislative efforts for a ban on the therapy failed earlier this year.  The faith known widely as the Mormon church opposed a previous version of the rule because it wanted assurances that church leaders and members who are therapists would be allowed to provide spiritual counseling for parishioners or families — which were included in the latest conversion therapy ban plan.</p><p><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/utah-set-become-19th-state-155844890.html">Link to source</a></p><p><img src="http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aOXfPo3.xVs0.es81u45Gg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/"></p><hr><p><img src="https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/190131daff22e56a411b1166ff0ff54d"></p><hr></body></html>
